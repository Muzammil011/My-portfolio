        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I'm a final year BCA student at Amity University and currently working on a TCS iON remote internship as part of my academic program.
        </p>
        <p>
          Iâ€™m building my skills in test automation, API testing, performance testing, and CI/CD pipelines with a focus on writing reliable, maintainable test code.
        </p>
        <p>
          This portfolio is a reflection of my self-driven learning journey toward becoming a skilled SDET.
